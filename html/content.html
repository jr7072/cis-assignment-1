                CIS 2336-INTERNET APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, SUMMER 2023
            </h1>
            <p class="first-paragraph text-item">
                <b><i>CIS 2336</i></b> is a one-semester, sophomore level course that introduces many technologies
                that contribute to sophisticated information systems and applications readily available
                via the World Wide Web and Internet today. The technologies include markup
                languages such as HTML and XML, structured data formats such as CSS for styling HTML,
                client-side coding for building dynamic and interactive applications using ECMA6
                compliant JavaScript and server-side coding for enabling and building dynamic and
                interactive content into applications.
            </p>
            <p class="second-paragraph text-item">
                Because the technologies are many, the course provides an overview and introduction
                together with hands-on exercises and assignments. The only way to become proficient
                with these technologies is to work with them hands-on, possibly for many, many hours.
                Thus, proficiency in one semester is not possible, but an overview of the technologies
                with some hands-on experience is. That is what the course delivers along with a
                conceptual understanding of how the different pieces work together to deliver the high-
                quality web applications of todayâ€™s World Wide Web. The course provides a foundation
                for more in depth learning and prepares students for upper division courses and
                projects in CIS.
